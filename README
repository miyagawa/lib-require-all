NAME
    lib::require::all - A tiny pragma to load all files from a lib directory

SYNOPSIS
      perl -Mlib::require::all=lib ...

DESCRIPTION
    lib::require::all is a pragma to load all "*.pm" files in a given
    directory ("lib" by default). The lib directory is automatically added
    to @INC via lib pragma automatically.

    Handy to preload all modules with tools like forkprove.
